Centuries ago, Latin was the language of the Roman Empire; today, it is still very much alive. Latin is used as the language of science, law, and medicine. Languages that evolved from Latin (the Romance languages) are now spoken by hundreds of millions of people. If you know where to look, you will encounter Latin every day in the Western world — from famous mottos, to engravings on landmark buildings, to sayings on our currency, Latin is all around us. So whether you want to build your English vocabulary, read classic poetry and literature, improve your ability to learn other languages, understand more about an ancient culture, or just get in touch with the toga-wearing senator that lives in your heart, we’ve got the language for you.
