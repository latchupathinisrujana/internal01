Duolingo helps you learn new vocabulary and grammar through five-minute games and quizzes on their easy-to-use app. Each lesson comes with very cute illustrations and animations to make it even more fun to use.

The program gets you to start creating sentences from the very beginning, always teaching words and phrases in context, and there is voice recognition software for pronunciation exercises.

And the best part is that you can do all this in just five minutes per day!
